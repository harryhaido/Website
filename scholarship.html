            <h2>Scholarship</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout my academic journey, I have diligently worked to achieve various scholarships 
                and academic honors. These accolades are a testament to my commitment to learning and 
                the effort I have invested from a young age. By maintaining high grades and actively 
                engaging in extracurricular activities, I have been fortunate enough to receive scholarships 
                that recognize my dedication and academic achievements.

                I received the first scholarship during my time at Birmingham International Collegiate of Canada 
                while I was in high school. This recognition served as a validation of my hard work, academic achievements, 
                and dedication to my studies. It further motivated me to continue striving for excellence in my education.

            <p>
                Upon entering the University of Windsor, I was honored to receive another entrance scholarship. This scholarship 
                not only provided financial assistance but also reaffirmed my commitment to pursuing higher education and fueled 
                my passion for further academic and personal growth. These scholarships have been instrumental in supporting my 
                educational journey and have inspired me to continue excelling in my chosen field of software engineering.
